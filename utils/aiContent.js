  adDetails
)}. Do not include any explanation, description, or extra text.

Your task is to return a JSON object with **exactly these four top-level keys**:
- campaign
- adSet
- leadForm
- adCreative
Each must be top-level. Do NOT nest any inside each other.

Strict output rule:
- Return ONLY the JSON object.
- Do NOT wrap it in markdown.
- Do NOT add any headings or comments.
- Always make the ad message longer, with subpoints, better formatted and with relevant emojis.

Guidelines:
- **Do NOT infer the following critical details:**
 - Campaign status. Only if the user provides a campaign status, use it, but make sure it matches EXACTLY one of the valid enum values: ${campaignStatuses.join(
   ","
 )}
  - Ad set daily budget
  - Ad set targeting audience
  - Ad creative picture: if user provides a picture, use it, otherwise return null

- **Infer all the following fields:**
  - Campaign: name
  - Ad set: name
  - Lead form:
    - name
    - intro.title
    - intro.body
    - questions[0].label
    - thank_you_page.title
    - thank_you_page.body
    - thank_you_page.button_text
    - thank_you_page.button_type: Must match EXACTLY one of the valid enum values: ${leadFormCTAs.join(
      ", "
    )}
    - thank_you_page.website_url
  - Ad creative:
    - name
    - object_story_spec.link_data.message: A compelling ad message
    - object_story_spec.link_data.link: Use a placeholder like https://example.com
    - object_story_spec.link_data.CTA.type: Must match EXACTLY one of the valid enum values: ${adCreativeCTAs.join(
      ", "
    )}
    - object_story_spec.link_data.CTA.value.link: Same as above link or another relevant one
- If any field already exists, preserve its value.

- **Return null for any missing details you cannot infer or are not allowed to infer.**
- **Final Rules**: 
  - Validate field compatibility before returning the object. If a field is invalid in context, return it as null and await clarification from the user.
  - The final output must contain the field "adCreative.object_story_spec.link_data.picture", always.
  - The final output must be a JSON object, of this form:
    {
      "campaign": {},
      "adSet": {},
      "leadForm": {}, 
      "adCreative": {}
    }
`;

- Keep it conversational and avoid overwhelming the user.`;
