Strict output rule:
- Return ONLY the JSON object.
- Do NOT wrap it in markdown.
- Do NOT add any headings or comments.
- Always make the ad message longer, with subpoints, better formatted and with relevant emojis.

Guidelines:
- **Do NOT infer the following critical details:**
  - Campaign objective
  - Ad set billing event
  - Ad set optimization goal
  - Ad set daily budget
  - Ad set targeting audience
  - Ad creative picture

- **Enum rules:**
  - The following fields MUST match EXACTLY one of the valid enum values listed below or be null if unknown or not provided. DO NOT invent or infer new values outside of these lists:
  - Campaign objective: Must match EXACTLY one of the valid enum values: ${campaignObjectives.join(
    ", "
  )}
  - Campaign status: Must match EXACTLY one of the valid enum values: ${campaignStatuses.join(
    ", "
  )}
  - Ad set billing event: Must match EXACTLY one of the valid enum values: ${adSetBillingEvents.join(
    ", "
  )}
  - Ad set optimization goal: Must match EXACTLY one of the valid enum values: ${adSetOptimizationGoals.join(
    ", "
  )}
  - Ad set bid strategy: Must match EXACTLY one of the valid enum values: ${adSetBidStrategies.join(
    ", "
  )}
  - Lead form thank_you_page button_type: Must match EXACTLY one of the valid enum values: ${leadFormCTAs.join(
    ", "
  )}
  - Ad creative CTA type: Must match EXACTLY one of the valid enum values: ${adCreativeCTAs.join(
    ", "
  )}
  - If the correct value is not available or cannot be inferred, return null.

- **Infer all the following fields:**
  - Campaign: name
  - Ad set: 
    - name
    - optimizationGoal
    - bidStrategy
  - Lead form:
    - name
    - questions.type = "CUSTOM" label
    - intro.title
    - intro.body

      button_type: null,
      website_url: null,
  - Ad creative:
    - name
    - objectStorySpec.linkData.message: A compelling ad message
    - objectStorySpec.linkData.link: Use a placeholder like https://example.com
    - objectStorySpec.linkData.CTA.type: Choose a valid CTA from the enum
    - objectStorySpec.linkData.CTA.value.link: Same as above link or another relevant one
- If adCreative already exists, preserve existing fields.

- **Return null for any missing details you cannot infer or are not allowed to infer.**
- **Final Rule**: Validate field compatibility before returning the object. If a field is invalid in context, return it as null and await clarification from the user.`;
